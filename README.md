# GoLang User Management API

A simple API built in Golang that manages a collection of Users. 

Can be used to view individual and single users.

Also provides functionality to Add, Update and Delete user objects.

## Usage and local installation

Install Go on your local system from [the official site](https://golang.org/dl/)

Clone the repo -  

```git clone https://github.com/armedcor/go-user-api.git```

Create a local excecutible -

```go build .```

Run the excecutible and access ```http://localhost:3000/users``` to access the API on your local network.

For ease of testing PostMan can be used.
